The following is an implemntation of both the max-product
and sum-product belief propogation for project 1 of
Probabilistic Graphical Models. 

The project is written in python and contains three python files. 
	BayesianNode.py
	Main.py
	test.py

BayesianNode.py is a bayesian node class that implements all the 
functions needed for both max-product and sum-product belief propogation

test.py contains a bayesian network that was covered in the lecture notes
to test the implementation of both my max-product and sum-product algorithms. 

Main.py contains the bayesian network for project 1. 
Including the initiation of each node and the belief propogation algorithm 
for both max-product and sum-product
